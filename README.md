# Demonstrator/TA Marketplace

Each year the School of Computer Science and Statistics assigns Demonstrators and Teaching Assistants to modules to support the delivery of labs and tutorials and to assist with the grading of student work. This is currently a largely manual process performed by staff in the School, supported by IT systems for maintaining relevant data. 

This project will turn the allocation process on its head and instead allow Demonstrators and Teaching Assistants to pick the modules that they wish to be
assigned to, subject to some constraints. This will be the primary functionality. Secondary functionality will include an approval workflow for demonstrator allocation
and functionality for an administrator to manually change allocations.
